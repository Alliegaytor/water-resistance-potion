# Water Resistance Potion

Adds a water resistance potion that protects the user from water damage that isn't drowning.

It allows this non-expansive list of entities to become immune to damage from water:

* Enderman
* Blaze
* Any Origin \(from the [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) mod\) with "origins:water_vulnerability"
  * [Blazeborn](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/base_contents/origins/blazeborn/)
  * [Enderian](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/base_contents/origins/enderian/)

Brewing recipe:

![](docs/BrewingRecipe.png)

In a brewing stand, combine an awkward potion with a sponge. To make the potion last longer, add redstone.

The potions are found commonly in the loot of shipwrecks, sometimes in ancient cities, and rarely among other places.
